# mqtt_things

# status: working but very coupled to my own personal projects

This repo is pretty much all spaghetti, there might be some useful things for you in there though (pretty much all Go code); of note:

-   Working integration w/ Broadlink RM4 Mini
-   Wrappers around 3 different MQTT libs (don't ask)
-   MQTT Prometheus exporter
-   Open Weather MQTT publisher
